# Ts3Client
Implementation of the TS3 client in C++

//ToDo littel doku.

# FAQ

[Why do you need that?]
> This software works with the same protocol as teamspeak clients. This allowd us to use all the features of 
  Teamspeak in our solution. This will be the basis of our freaxbot.

[Why C++?]
> C++ is one of the most resource-saving programming languages. In addition, the program can be easily run on Linux   and Windows. And it is the home language from TS3.

[Is the Client legal?]
> Yes. This program does not use any libs or resources from TeamSpeak.

[What can i do with the software?]
> This software is only for developer to build staff in C++ for TS3. The Client is not for end customers... 
  Please wait for the @Freaxbot
